              <p><span class="body">A story about Sony support and my lessons
                  learned. Maybe it will provide hope for those in a similar
                  position.</span> </p>
              <p class="body">Ok, so let me explain, in May I decided it was
                time to ditch all of my CRT monitors, there were six in varying
                sizes that ended up taking up just far too much space. So after
                giving most of them away I came to the conclusion I wanted dual
                Sony SDM-P82s, I know I could have gotten one 23&quot; apple
                but, I need to hook up a lot of machines, so dual 18&quot; is better,
                but there were none in stock anywhere, expect for <a href="http://www.selfridges.co.uk" target="_blank">Selfridges</a> and
                that was ex-demo. Now, I'm very impatient so I decided
                on two Sony SDM-X82s - the cool thing about these monitors is
                that they have three inputs each so I can hook up six machines,
                or five and one dual monitor setup. This is a space saving on
                its own, not even mentioning the fact that the X82s are quite
                slim anyway. Well off to Tottenham Court Road. First problem:
                everywhere is sold out, except for one shop. Fine, I buy that
                and have to wait for a few days for the second one. A few days
                later back I go, this time to <a href="http://www.selfridges.co.uk" target="_blank">Shasonic</a> and
                picked up the other (for a slightly inflated price)<br />

                a month and a few days all was well. Then suddenly monitor two
                refused to display anything, hmm, weird I thought: maybe it had
                just overheated, as when I felt the back it was very hot, so
                I left it to cool. No, when I turned it on again, the screen
                was garbled and cut out. Ok, <a href="http://www.selfridges.co.uk" target="_blank">Shasonic </a>would
                surely give me a new one, it was only a month old after all?
                No hope of that, they just referred me to Sony. My first advice:</p>

                pretty helpful, they arranged a replacement monitor, although they
                only had white available. They delivered it next day and collected
                the faulty one. I asked repeatedly whether I could just have a
                new black one, as a month seemed a short time to own the monitor,
                but apparently the best they could do was a repair.</p>
              <p>Fast forward
                  four, maybe five weeks. During this time I had to put up with
                different coloured monitors, and although no guests commented
                on it, well,
              one black and one white, tsk, the embarrassment!</p></td>

            <td colspan="3"><p class="body">Back to the story, I get a call,
                monitor is fixed, can I be in on Monday to collect it? Ok, Monday
                comes and I make sure I'm at home, the delivery guys come,
                drop of the monitor and ask for the white one back, I've
                already unplugged everything, but here is</p>
              <p class="body"><span class="subheading">Lesson number two: </span>Always
                check the repaired item before you accept it.</p>
              <p class="body">I learned this when <a href="http://www.dixons.co.uk" target="_blank">Dixons</a> took
                my very expensive DV cam away and sent it back even more broken,
                this was a few years ago, yes I was young and foolish I would
                never shop at <a href="http://www.dixons.co.uk" target="_blank">Dixons</a> again.</p>
              <p class="body">I insist I check the repaired one first. The guys
                seem miffed and complain that they have other deliveries to make,
                but thank goodness I plugged in the repaired monitor. Analogue
                one, fine, analogue two, fine, DVI input, nothing, ok I reboot
                the machine, hmmm still nothing. So I unplug the DVI from monitor
                one, try that, nothing. So Sony have managed to fix analogue
                and leave the DVI broken, erm, ok, so back downstairs I grab
                the white monitor, and tell the delivery guys the situation.
                They let me sign saying unacceptable, and I keep the white monitor.</p>
              <p class="body">Next: straight on the phone to Sony. The poor woman
                who works at the monitor call centre, (their only employee by
                all signs) can't help so I get to speak to a more senior
                person, and am told that she will phone me back that day. I wait
                and nothing happens. Now, I'm usually pretty mild-mannered
                but I am starting to get a bit upset about spending about &pound;1300
                on two monitors and then finding all this hassle. Next day the
                Sony woman rings - now I know that she's only doing her
                job, but she is quite blunt and very sure I cannot get a refund
                or have a new monitor, the best I can get is mine repaired.</p>
              <p class="body"> <span class="subheading">Lesson three:</span> do
                not give in when companies tell you NO.</p>
              <p class="body">I'm irritated and I let her know so - it's
                not her fault but I am not happy with the options they give me.
                Eventually she says there is something she can do: convene some
                mystical group of heads of Sony to do something about it. (Erm,
                not sure I believe that bit but anyway, that's what she told
                me). I agree to this as there is no way I will accept the other
                alternatives. One week passes, in this time I go around professing
                my hatred of Sony support. Then, checking my messages, there's
                a missed call. Ah ha, a solution! They can't get me an
                X82, none in stock, but they can send me a brand new SDM-P82,
                better looking and more expensive.</p>

                the best I'm going to get. After arranging the delivery
                time I smile. A few days later, the SDM-P82 arrives, and now
                I am in a predicament: I want dual monitors and I want them to
                match. So, off to Tottenham Court Road again, I buy another P82
                and bring it home. Now my desk looks great, I have matching flat
                panels again and the only downer is that I have a spare X82.
                I did think I would be able to use it as the monitor for my new
                G5 when I buy it (I have this planned to replace my aging Mac)
                but when I put all three on my desk it just looked weird, and
                anyway, you can't run a Mac with a PC monitor, it just
                looks freaky. </p>
              <p><span class="body">So, if anyone wants an immaculate Sony SDM-X82
                  for a very knocked down price, say &pound;500, then please <a href="../contact.html">contact
                  me</a>. I want to keep it, but I just don't have anywhere
              for it to go.</span></p>

              <p class="body">After writing of
                    my experiences I was contacted by David Burton who
                    had also had an identical problem with his X82, he let me
                    know he also received a P82 as a replacement so if anyone
                    is in the same spot as we both were, there definitely is
              hope. :-)</p>
              <p class="body">Also after this and the AIBO head incident it seems
                I'm not alone in having <a href="http://www.belgers.com/computers/sonyrommel.html" target="_blank">Sony
                problems</a>.<br />
