      <p class="body"><strong>Andrew Kendall - Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Work in progress FAQ, currently in no order at all. To
        ask questions <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/andrewkendall/66235.html?mode=reply" target="_blank">post
      here</a>.</p>
      <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="body"><strong> What is your favourite colour?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Blue and orange equally.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>What camera do you use?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Take a look <a 
href="cameraequipment.html" 
target="_blank">here</a>. I keep this page updated with a list of my current
        equipment.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>How did you first get publications to notice your
          photos and eventually purchase them for their magazine? </strong></p>
      <p class="body">As far as I have been told I was noticed via a post on
        thelibertines.org forum which pointed to my web site and the <a href="/pages/photogallery/2/" target="_blank">first
        proper photographs</a>        I had taken of The Libertines. A staff
        member at NME saw them and passed them around the office, eleven days
        after taking them one of the pictures editors emailed me saying if I
        ever shoot any more I should send them. Six days after that I took <a href="/pages/photogallery/9/" target="_blank">these
        photos</a> sent them in and they ended up
        being my <a href="/pages/published/magazines/showpage/16/index.html" target="_blank">first
        published music pictures</a>.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong> What's the most embarrassing CD(or record!)your own?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I converted most of my music to MP3 years ago, all
          my CDs are in boxes in my mum&rsquo;s loft and I've almost blocked
          out the memory of the worst CDs I have. I probably own some terrible
          stuff but if you stalk my <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/andrewkendall/" target="_blank">Audioscrobbler</a> you can find out what awful
      stuff I am actually still listening to.</p>
      <p> <span class="body"><strong>From your experience what is the best way to get into photography professionally?</strong></span></p>
      <p class="body"> Make sure you love doing it, practice loads, get good
        at composing shots with a point and shoot and then go on to worry about
        shutter speed, ISO, aperture, etc. Work digitally, learn your camera
        inside out, learn Photoshop and when you feel you are good enough build
        a web site and find ways of getting people to visit it.</p>
      <p> <span class="body"><strong>Do you have a favourite of all your pictures?</strong></span></p>
      <p class="body">I don't really have one 'favourite' but I picked out some
        of my favourites for my <a href="http://www.grassrootsx.com/andrewkendall" target="_blank">grassroots
        xchange profile</a>.</p>
      <p> <span class="body"><strong>Who would you rather have sex with, Pete or Carl? :) </strong></span></p>
      <p class="body">I&rsquo;ll leave
        that for <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/albion_fic/" target="_blank">albion_fic</a> to
        decide.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>What are your thoughts on Brandon Flowers' pink leather
      jacket?</strong></p>
      <p class="body"> I have no opinion on Brandon Flowers' pink leather jacket.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>How do you keep up with all these bands?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">The internet is a wonderful thing.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you condition your hair?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">No I do not, but I am told it is in very good condition.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>As a follow up, do you blow dry, towel dry, air
      dry or use a combination of methods?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Towel / air dry.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Better movie: Almost Famous or The Royal Tenenbaums?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I&rsquo;ve never seen The Royal Tenenbaums, I thought
        Almost Famous was well made but very tame, it&rsquo;s nowhere near rock
        and roll enough.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Burger King or McDonalds?!</strong></p>
      <p class="body">We all know that fast food is bad, but if you want to take me out make
        it Burger King.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>What was your first gig?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Blur in Birmingham in 1995.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Will you marry me?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Possibly&hellip;</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you get into gigs for free?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Yes, most of the time.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Is your wage packet from the NME fair?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I&rsquo;m not complaining.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Could you get me a date with Imran Ahmed?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I can try, email me your details (and a photo) and
          I&rsquo;ll pass them
      on.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>How awesome is Morrissey?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Very.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you know how to knit?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I don&rsquo;t remember ever trying.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Who's cutting your hair?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I have recently taken to cutting my own hair, but
          I&rsquo;m open to
      offers.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Kings of Leon. Beards on or Beards off?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">On.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Why do you suppose Morrissey bandaged his nipple in the
        November spawned a monster video? </strong></p>
      <p class="body">I suspect you have been reading &quot;<a href="http://www.morrissey-solo.com/article.pl?sid=03/09/30/1530225" target="_blank">15
          things to say to piss off a Smiths fan</a>&quot;.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Why don't you come to my town? </strong></p>
      <p class="body">If there&rsquo;s something
        worth photographing let me know and I&rsquo;ll
        try. </p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you hate airplanes?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I have no fear of flying. </p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Which is better 1.4 50mm or 2.8 70 - 200mm?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">They are both
      great lenses for different purposes.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Why do you use such big lens (70-200)when
      you're so close?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">Most of the time I use the 24-70L the 70-200 is more
      of a festival lens.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you use a flashgun? if so how come as I'm always
        told I'm not allowed?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">It depends on the situation, most big bands /
          venues won't let you use flash.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you use a tripod (at concerts)</strong></p>
      <p class="body">No.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you use flash (at concerts)?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">It depends on available
      light and if I'm allowed.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Which photo sensitivity do you use (at concerts)?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I am currently
        using ISO 800 with flash and 1000-1250 without.</p>
      <p class="body"><strong>Do you prefer Coca Cola or Pepsi?</strong></p>
      <p class="body">I'd have to say Coke.</p>
