Back in 2000 this website was created using Macromedia DreamWeaver, PHP and MySQL. I ran it on many services over the years and settled on DreamHost from 2006 until 2020 when the version of PHP it requires became end of life. At that point I used VMware ESXi to create a CentOS 7 install with the required PHP version and ran their server from home. In 2023 I moved and required a more minimal way of keeping the site running. I used SiteSucker to create a static version of the site which Iâ€™ve modified to maintain the essence of how it use to operate. The site is now designed to be served statically from Amazon S3.
