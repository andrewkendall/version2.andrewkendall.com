# version2.andrewkendall.com

Back in 2000, this website was created using Macromedia Dreamweaver, PHP, and MySQL. At the time, I was lecturing at the London College of Printing, and its primary purpose was to deliver learning resources.

In late 2003, I began taking pictures of the then-exploding music scene in London. I built the gallery component and admin system for the site and started uploading my photos.

Over the years, I hosted the site on various services, eventually settling on DreamHost from 2006 until 2020, when the required PHP version reached end-of-life. At that point, I used VMware ESXi to create a CentOS 7 installation with the necessary PHP version and ran the server from home.

In late 2022, I moved and needed a more minimal solution to keep the site running. Using SiteSucker, I created a static version of the site and modified it to preserve the essence of its original functionality. The site is now designed to be served statically.

At the moment, the site is running on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront, costing less than £1 per month to operate at the time of writing. I intend to keep it online for as long as possible, but if it ever goes offline, please feel free to create a mirror.

Downloading is as simple as clicking the <>Code button and selecting “Download ZIP” on the GitHub page.
