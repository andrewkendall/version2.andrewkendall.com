# version2.andrewkendall.com

Back in 2000, this website was created using Macromedia DreamWeaver, PHP and MySQL. At that point, I was lecturing at the London College of Printing and its primary purpose was to deliver learning resources.

In late 2003 I started to take pictures of the then-exploding music scene in London, I built the gallery component and admin system of the site and started uploading.

I ran it on many services over the years and settled on DreamHost from 2006 until 2020 when the version of PHP it requires became end-of-life. At that point, I used VMware ESXi to create a CentOS 7 install with the required PHP version and ran the server from home.

In late 2022 I moved and required a more minimal way of keeping the site running. I used SiteSucker to create a static version of the site which Iâ€™ve modified to maintain the essence of how it used to operate. The site is now designed to be served statically from Amazon S3.
